Think of me like a school. 
Not a university, or an institution, but more of a flanked memory of elementary school, on a windy day, and all your best friends are in a different class, or at home sick. You don’t like school. No one really does. The teacher has made their class their world and most things bounce off your head. There are two parts of me, with the line between them wide and covered in molasses, so it’s a little hard to find the difference. But they’re called class and recess.
 First I am class.
I am not claiming to be some orwellian force. And you’d be boring to read me that way. Class is not do as I say or die. There is no real risk and no real reward and that makes me a weird, amorphous, bureaucracy. 
I am fuzzy,
frankenstein,
woken up sleep,
being guided by the needs of my body.
Eyes open, mouth open, lungs breath, in and out, again forever, arms pull down covers push up body- no, not full body, just upper torso up yeah sit this is sitting. Keep breathing.
You are always told by yourself what to do. And you are so, so young. So let a teacher help you.
Surely, some of it makes sense. You can follow point to line to point, even if some are dotted.
Isn’t that nice? To be a little slow, like you’re sniffing markers, while I hold your hand, and give you one little thing to do every now and then? Point of proof, you hear my command, and I let you keep going, you keep living you. Everything in the middle is noise. And it is so boring. It is waking up sleep.
Next I am recess
This is your freedom. It is kind of like a prison with flimsy walls. Thank you for listening to me now you can do what you want. You have to work a little for that though, I don’t know you. I am just a school. Here are toys, and a playground, I haven’t checked how well they work or if you like them, but at least you can choose that right? You are still confused, but the burden of that, exciting and annoying now lies on you. This must be what it’s like to be old like your parents. Passing balls and on swings all day in the buildings they call work. I guess that’s lucky. This is the freedom, of figuring out freedom

Am I a school of nick? Of learning about nick? Maybe a little. But you don’t get much of that in class, you get it more at recess. I give you more to work with more to be entertained by but yeah nothings on the simplest platter. I am LEGO’s. Make your future house. Chew on me, step on me I don’t care. But whatever you get out of it came from me whether you like it or not. This is the biggest authorship can be: the spread of information.
But also, all of this is so so silly. I hope you can laugh at the site. I hope you can have fun during school.
